Introduction to OMERO.scripts
=============================

OMERO.scripts are the OME version of plugins, allowing you to extend the
functionality of your OMERO installation.

The OMERO scripting service allows scripts to be uploaded to the server so
that image processing and analysis, and other functionality, can be carried
out there rather than on your local machine. Scripts are generally written in
Python, but other languages are also supported, like Jython. MATLAB scripts
are supported natively as well as via a Python wrapper as described in
:doc:`matlab-scripts`.
