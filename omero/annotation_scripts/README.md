MIF developed scripts for OMERO
===========================

This is a collection of python scripts written for 
the [OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/) installation in the 
[Microbial Imaging Facility](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-science/microbial-imaging-facility/about-us) (MIF),
which is part of the [ithree institute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/ithree-institute)
at the [University of Technology Sydney](ihttps://www.uts.edu.au).

These scripts are primarily for the handling of metadata.  Details and instructions can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/evenhuis/omero-user-scripts/wiki)

The scripts were developed using the following resources:
