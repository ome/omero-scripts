Developer Installation
----------------------

1. Fork [omero-user-scripts](https://github.com/ome/omero-user-scripts/fork) in your own GitHub account

2. Change into the scripts location of your OMERO installation

        cd OMERO_DIST/lib/scripts

3. Clone the repository

        git clone git@github.com:YOURGITUSER/omero-user-scripts.git YOUR_SCRIPTS

Adding a script
---------------

1. Choose a naming scheme for your scripts. The name of the clone
   (e.g. "YOUR_SCRIPTS"), the script name, and all sub-directories will be shown
   to your users in the UI, so think about script organization upfront.

   a. If you don't plan to have many scripts, then you need not have any sub-directories
      and can place scripts directly under YOUR_SCRIPTS.

   b. Otherwise, create a suitable sub-directory. Examples of directories in use can be
      found in the [official scripts](https://github.com/ome/scripts) repository.

2. Place your script in the chosen directory:
  * If you have an existing script, simply save it.
  * Otherwise, copy [Example.txt](Example.txt) and edit it in place. (Don't use git mv)

3. Add the file to git, commit, and push.

Testing your script
-------------------

1. List the current scripts in the system

        path/to/bin/omero script list

2. List the parameters

        path/to/bin/omero script params SCRIPT_ID

3. Launch the script

        path/to/bin/omero script launch SCRIPT_ID

4. See the [developer documentation](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero/developers/scripts/)
   for more information on testing and modifying your scripts.
